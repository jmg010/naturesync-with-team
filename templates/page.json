Constant shoe use and exposure to electronics contribute to this problem.</p><p>The Earth’s free electrons act like a natural battery, offering health benefits. Standing barefoot or using Earthing products transfers these electrons to our bodies, helping expel negative energy.</p><p>Benefits of grounding include reduced inflammation, better sleep, less pain, improved circulation, lower blood pressure, reduced stress, and boosted mood and energy. Grounding during sleep is especially beneficial, as researched by Clint Ober for over 20 years.</p>",
